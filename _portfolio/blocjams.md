## Explanation

BlocJams was my first project that I started from scratch. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript(JQuery) to construct it. Starting out, I made the web app with the old fashioned way, DOM Scripting in plain old JavaScript. Then, I simplified the code using JQuery.

## Problem

I had trouble keeping track of all the functions because there was so many features in the app. For example, the play/pause button in the albums page is quite sophisticated.

## Solution

I eventually got to the conclusion that I cannot memorize all the functions and variables, so I started diagramming.

## Conclusion

I learned that taking notes of what connects to what is essential in developing a "big" app.
