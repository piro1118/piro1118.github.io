title: My dream as a frontend developer
---

## As an Entrepreneur
My goal as a frontend developer is closely relevant to my goal as an entrepreneur. I want to change the way people live by letting people have full knowledge of their options.

For example, a person who wants to move to a new place might not consider moving to a place they have never been before, but if the person had full understanding of all the diverse option he/she has, the outcome will possibly be different.

I think there are so many data and know-how’s that are undermined, and are not used by people in the way it should be. So as an entrepreneur, my dream is to collect these data and know-how’s, and present it to my customers in the best way possible.


## As a Frontend Developer
In order to accomplish what I want to do as an entrepreneur, I need to be a good frontend developer. As a frontend developer, my goal is to be able to optimize the way information is presented to the user. I will need to learn more in the following 2 key fields.

First, I will need to learn responsive design so that people will have the best user experience regardless of their device. The information that I want to present should be like water, flowing from one place to another, without getting stuck at any point of the service.

Second, I will need to make my service interactive. Going through all the information in the world is impossible. But if the website has a fully interactive feature, the user will be able to dig through the information, focusing on the place they want to know more.

The world of frontend developer changes really fast, so I will need to keep studying and keep up with the new trend. Eventually, I hope I will be able to present my users the best experience and a better life through my work.
