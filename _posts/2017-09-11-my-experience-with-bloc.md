title: My experience with Bloc
---

I started the Bloc curriculum on April 24, 2017. Since my 1st course, 4 month has passed and I think it is time for me to reflect on the journey I have walked.

## Starting Out

I have long thought about learning how to program. But taking the first step to actually learn took more than several years. Looking back, I think this was because the vast landscape of the “programming world” looked so overwhelming to me. But the simple question, “Don’t I want to make something exciting?” led me to take the first small step into the world.

After deciding to take the first step, I looked for the best program that I can learn. There are various programs out in the world, including free ones, but Bloc looked the best for me.

The primary reason for this was because Bloc has frontend and backend fundamentals in its curriculum. As I said earlier, the “programming world” is vast and grabbing hold of the big picture was essential for me.

Also, a course that can be concluded online is essential to me. I’m located in Japan and there are local courses available, but physically going to a school is difficult with my long working hours.

The final reason I selected Bloc is because it has mentors that can support my progress. Learning a new thing from scratch is always a hard thing to do, but learning by yourself is especially hard. Being able to learn from others is a value I would pay for.

## Learning from nothing

After enrolling in the curriculum, I started out with HTML and CSS. This was not hard for me, because I had the experience in adjusting the layout of my personal blogs. But when I reached to the curriculum on Javascript and Git, things began to change.

I had absolutely no knowledge of how to code in Javascript. I had to build up my knowledge one to next, keeping notes and frequently going back to what I learned a day earlier. I also had no knowledge in managing a project using Git. I didn’t even have any experience in using command line. The concept of being able to change something on the internet with the word “git push origin master” was a big surprise to me.

I eventually got though the learning phase of frontend fundamentals and I am now trying to use what I learned. This is also a great challenge.

# What I learned - Learning to learn

During the 4 months of learning the frontend side technology, I learned something more than the actual way to code. I learned how to learn within the time constraint. After graduating from college, I didn’t have the opportunity to learn outside my professional carrier. So I didn’t realize learning outside of work, with not enough time to invest, is so difficult. I obviously was not a genius, and reading once was not sufficient for me to master something.

The best way for me to learn something faster than losing it was to keep good notes. Keeping track of what I’m doing and what I learned was the most powerful way to let me build up my knowledge.


# The road I’m heading

Now that I’m a little shy of completing half of the course, I’m really excited to get to learn the backend technologies. Going back to the fundamentals and learning things from scratch is a challenging and an exciting experience.

With 4 months of learning I have come quite far. After a whole year of learning, I’m sure I would have a whole new world before me that I could have not otherwise understood.
